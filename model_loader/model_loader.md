# Managing Ollama Models with ModelLoader

This guide explains the ModelLoader class, which simplifies managing Ollama models within your CrewAI framework.

## Purpose

- Streamlines access to Ollama models through convenient pull_or_create method.
- Handles model pulling from existing deployments or on-the-fly creation using the Ollama API.
- Stores created models in a central repository for efficient reuse.

## Usage

```python
from model_loaders import ModelLoader

# Use an existing model

summarizer = ModelLoader.pull_or_create("summarizer", temperature=0.7)

# Create a new model if needed

translator = ModelLoader.pull_or_create("translator", model_name="opus-mt-en-es", temperature=0.5)

# Use model methods for generation, etc.
summary = summarizer.generate_text("Summarize this text...")
translation = translator.generate_text("Translate this sentence to Spanish.")
```

Tips:

- Provide meaningful model_name and kwargs for specific model configurations.
- Consider caching mechanisms for frequently used models to optimize performance.
- Implement robust error handling for potential API issues during pulling or creation.
- Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your specific API interaction logic.
