# Creating Custom Agents

This guide explains how to create custom AI agents using your CrewAI framework. Each agent encapsulates an Ollama language model and defines methods for specific functionalities.

## Structure

Place your agent files within the agents directory.
Each file defines a class inheriting from AgentBase (found in core.py).
Implement the respond method to handle prompts and generate responses.
Add other methods for specialized tasks (e.g., summarize, translate).

## Example

    ```python
    # CODE EXAMPLE COMING SOON!!
    #
    #
    #
    #
    #
    #
    #
    #TODO: Add example code
    ```

## Tips

- Choose appropriate model names and temperatures for your agent's purpose.
- Consider agent personas and backstories for personalization.
- Thoroughly test your agent with various prompts and inputs.
